## Description

This app is a **cataract detection** software meant to identify cataracts based on fundus images uploaded to the app. The purpose of the app is reduce the workload of ophthalmologists, who currently must hand-label fundus images of eye lens as "Cataract" or "Normal." This app will greatly aid rural areas, where there is often only **1** ophthalmologist per **100,000** patients! This app would allow ophthalmologists, or patients themselves, to use an **ophthalmoscope**, which is attachable to a phone camera, to take a picture of patients' eyes. These pictures would then be uploaded to the app, which will return a diagnosis as well as the probability of the accuracy of the diagnosis.
